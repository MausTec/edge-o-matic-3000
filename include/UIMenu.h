/**
 * Time in ms to ignore scroll events.
 *
 * This prevents that absolutely infuriating thing my CR-10 does when I go to scroll one item and it
 * registers two clicks because I was *kinda sorta* between the next thing. However, this also makes
 * it super annoying to scroll through menus at light speed, so this has been reduced from 500ms to
 * 300ms. There is truly no winning, but having this debounce here seemed to make my life slightly
 * less full of fire and rage.
 *
 * If I was an actual dragon, I would have set the scroll wheel on fire. Do I need larger smoothing
 * capacitors? 100nF was too big, 10nF seemed just right, but I still have this absolutely annoying
 * bounce that sometimes happens when you're in-between detents on the scroll wheel. Is this an issue
 * with the PEL12T? The no-name (also a PEL12 variant) SparkFun encoder does this too. I think every
 * encoder in the universe does this (see CR-10).
 *
 * Maybe I just need to learn patience when scrolling.
 * That would explain why the scroll wheel on my mouse is wearing out.
 *
 * But look, that scroll wheel has seen the duality of heal staff and murder gun when I mained Mercy,
 * and that is a pretty tense environment when I'm furiously scrolling to grab my pistol and shoot
 * a Junkrat for--     what was I on about?
 *
 * Oh yeah, rotary encoders are of the devil.
